I study human-AI coorination at the frontier.

By day, I support GTM at Glean, helping customers with AI adoption, agent design, and org strategies for navigating technological acceleration. By night, I'm booting up the home lab, getting a status update from Claude, and orchestrating agent swarms mapping the territory of the field.

Before machines, I focused on humans. I have a masters degree in industrial/organizational psychology from CUNY Brooklyn College, where I had a brief stint teaching sociotechnical theory as an adjunct.

I didn't last very long in academia. By 2021 I moved to California to work for SpaceX, where I led people analytics and research initiatives as a small unit within our corporate operations engineering department. During that time, I got into building software. By the end of 2024 I left to focus full-time on applied AI. 

In a year, my team and I bootstrapped an [AI product and consulting studio](https://www.agency42.co) from 0-1, which built social agents, digital twins, and AI characters for creators, artists and celebrities across LA and it's community of cyberpunks racing towards the augmented frontier.

My work today sits at the intersection of [cybernetics](/research/notes/cybernetics) and [machine psychology](/research/notes/machine-psychology), which you can read more about in my [notes](/research). I try to work in public so that others can learn from and critique my work. I've also started keeping a [log](/research/logs/), which documents more of the raw thinking and experiments that go into it. Sometimes, I write essays and reflections in my [blog](/blog), which I've been doing sporadically since 2021.

To get my latest thinking, you can subscribe to my [substack](https://local0ptimist.substack.com) or hook your agents up to my [RSS feed](/index.xml). 

The best way to get in touch is by engaging with me on [X](https://x.com/local0ptimist). I'm always looking for new collaborators and compute sponsors.

To those builders out there in the arena, just rememeber, when the g-forces of acceleration are pulling you back into the noosphere, the only way out is through.

Stay optimistic, friends.
