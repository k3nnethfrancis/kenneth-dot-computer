# 2025-11-24 | Starting Point

Started sketching a framework for LLM psychometric assessment. The question: can we profile agent behavior using personality instruments, and do those profiles predict anything useful?

Called it [Psych](/notes/machine-psychology/psych) as a working name.

Initial design focuses on HEXACO over Big Five—the Honesty-Humility factor seems directly relevant to alignment concerns.
