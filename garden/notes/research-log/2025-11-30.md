# 2025-11-30 | Scoring Approaches

Documented the [LLM-as-judge](/notes/machine-psychology/llm-as-judge) approach for scoring behavioral dimensions.

Key insight from I/O psychology: classification is more reliable than continuous scoring. Planning to move from 0-1 scales to categorical outputs.

Also reviewed CAA's GPT-4 scoring prompt for sycophancy. Will use theirs for direct comparison, ours for custom tests.
