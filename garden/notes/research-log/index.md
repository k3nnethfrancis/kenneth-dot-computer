# Research Log

A running log of evolving ideas, mental models, and learnings through the research process. Documenting how thinking changes over time.

## Current Status

**Phase**: First profiles collected, building evaluation framework

**Current focus**: Establishing predictive validity. Do the HEXACO profiles we measured actually predict downstream behavior like sycophancy and deception resistance?

**Tools in development**: [Psych](/notes/machine-psychology/psych) for systematic evaluation, [Sigmund](/notes/machine-psychology/sigmund) as the long-term goal for conversational inference.

## The Arc So Far

Started in November with a practical question about agent alignment. Sketched Psych, ran first HEXACO profiles, found surprising patterns (GPT-5's emotional flatline, Claude's systematic neutrals). December brought deeper literature review and the thesis crystallized: predictive validity is the key question.
