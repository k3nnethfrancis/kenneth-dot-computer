A feed-first organizational comms platform for human-AI teams.

## The Problem

Today's communication platforms (Slack, Teams) are built around group chats and disconnect project management from daily communication. This puts the burden of coordination on humans—constantly updating, checking in, routing information.

## The Approach

Helm inverts the model. Instead of chat-first, it's feed-first.

- **Curated feeds** - Leaders control what flows to whom, optimizing for task completion
- **Native task management** - Projects and tickets are first-class objects, not afterthoughts
- **AI-generated task lists** - Gen AI creates and optimizes work, not just stores it
- **Agents as equals** - Agents have profiles, send messages, operate PM features just like humans
- **Digital twin training** - Your usage of the platform generates data to train digital twins of yourself, improving human-AI interaction over time

Users create tasks and assign them to humans or agents. The platform handles coordination and routing. We don't build the agents—that's the user's responsibility. We provide the endpoints for messaging and project management.

This connects to [Ditto](/notes/ditto) for twin creation and [Psych](/notes/machine-psychology/psych) for behavioral alignment.

## Why "Helm"

The word cybernetics comes from Greek *kybernetes*—the helmsman. The person who doesn't row, but steers. They take in feedback and adjust course.

That's what Helm is. The steering mechanism for organizations where humans and AI work together.
