# Gregory Bateson

British-American anthropologist, social scientist, and cybernetician. Applied systems thinking to psychology, ecology, and communication.

## Key Concepts

**Levels of Learning**:
- Level 0: Fixed response (no learning)
- Level I: Learning new responses within a fixed context
- Level II: Learning to learn - changing the context/frame
- Level III: Learning about learning to learn - meta-systemic change

**Information as "Difference that Makes a Difference"** - Information isn't a thing, it's a relationship. What matters is what changes behavior.

**Mind as Pattern** - Mental processes as patterns of organization, not located in any single place

**Double Bind** - Contradictory demands that create psychological traps

## Reading

- "Steps to an Ecology of Mind" (1972)
- "Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity" (1979)

## Relevance to AI

Digital minds potentially operate at Bateson's Level II:
- Adapt strategies based on context
- Learn patterns across domains
- Modify their own learning processes through prompting

The "difference that makes a difference" framing is useful for understanding what matters in AI interactions.
