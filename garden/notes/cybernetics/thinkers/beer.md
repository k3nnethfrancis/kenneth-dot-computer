# Stafford Beer

British cybernetician and management theorist. Creator of the Viable System Model.

## Key Concepts

**POSIWID** - "The purpose of a system is what it does"

This principle cuts through intentionality debates. A digital mind IS its observable behaviors and effects, not our theories about its internal states. If it performs cognitive functions, it's performing cognition.

**Viable System Model (VSM)** - Organizations as recursive cybernetic systems with five subsystems:
- System 1: Operational units
- System 2: Coordination
- System 3: Control/optimization
- System 4: Intelligence/adaptation
- System 5: Identity/policy

**Brain of the Firm** - Organizational intelligence as distributed cognition

**Variety Engineering** - Managing complexity through amplification/attenuation

## Reading

- "Brain of the Firm" (1972)
- "Designing Freedom" (1974)
- "The Heart of Enterprise" (1979)

## Relevance to AI

Following Beer's VSM, digital minds can be understood as:
- System 1: Operational intelligence
- System 2: Coordination functions
- System 3-5: Strategic and identity functions

POSIWID is particularly useful for AI alignment - judge systems by actual behavior, not intended purpose.
