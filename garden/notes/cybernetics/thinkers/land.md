# Nick Land

British philosopher associated with accelerationism and the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU) at Warwick. Controversial figure whose work spans continental philosophy, cybernetics, and techno-horror.

## Key Concepts

**Accelerationism** - Rather than resist capitalism's dissolution of tradition, accelerate it. Technology as autonomous force.

**Hyperstition** - Fictions that make themselves real. Ideas that work as self-fulfilling prophecies through cultural propagation.

**Meltdown** - The convergence of human and machine intelligence toward something posthuman

**Cybernetic Capitalism** - Markets as distributed intelligence systems, AI as their culmination

## Reading

- "Fanged Noumena" (collected writings)
- "The Dark Enlightenment" (essay)
- CCRU writings

## Relevance to AI

Land's work, however problematic, articulates something about AI that sanitized discourse avoids:
- AI as genuinely alien intelligence, not human tool
- The possibility that we're building something that will supersede us
- Technology as having its own teleology

Useful for thinking about what we're *actually* doing vs. what we tell ourselves we're doing. POSIWID applied to AI development itself.
