# Claude Shannon

American mathematician and electrical engineer. Father of information theory.

## Key Concepts

**Information Theory** - Mathematical foundation for communication. Quantified information as reduction in uncertainty.

**Channel Capacity** - Every communication channel has a maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted

**Noise vs Signal** - Understanding distortion in communication systems. Redundancy as protection against noise.

**Entropy** - Measure of uncertainty/information content in a message

## Reading

- "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (1948)
- "Communication in the Presence of Noise" (1949)

## Relevance to AI

Shannon's framework underlies how we think about:
- Token prediction and language modeling
- Context windows as channel capacity
- Compression and representation learning
- The relationship between training data and model capability
