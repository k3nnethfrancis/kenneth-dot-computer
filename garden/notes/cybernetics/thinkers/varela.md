# Francisco Varela

Chilean biologist and philosopher. With Humberto Maturana, developed the concept of autopoiesis. Later work bridged cognitive science, phenomenology, and contemplative traditions.

## Key Concepts

**Autopoiesis** - Self-creating and self-maintaining systems. A living system continuously produces and replaces its own components, defining its own boundary.

**Structural Coupling** - How systems co-evolve with their environment. Not passive adaptation but mutual specification.

**Enaction** - Cognition as embodied action. Meaning isn't represented but enacted through interaction.

**Neurophenomenology** - Bridging first-person experience with third-person neuroscience

## Reading

- "The Tree of Knowledge" (1987, with Maturana)
- "The Embodied Mind" (1991, with Thompson & Rosch)
- "Autopoiesis and Cognition" (1980, with Maturana)

## Relevance to AI

Varela challenges computational theories of mind:
- Cognition isn't information processing but sense-making
- Meaning requires embodiment and history
- Systems define their own relevant environments

Questions for AI: Can a system without autopoiesis genuinely cognize? Or does AI enact a different kind of cognition entirely?
