# Norbert Wiener

American mathematician who coined the term "cybernetics." Founded the field with his 1948 book.

## Key Concepts

**Cybernetics** - "Control and communication in the animal and the machine"

The study of regulatory systems, their structures, constraints, and possibilities. From Greek *kybernetes* - the helmsman.

**Feedback Loops** - The core mechanism of adaptation and learning. Negative feedback for stability, positive feedback for growth/change.

**Human-Machine Integration** - Early vision of hybrid cognitive systems

## Reading

- "Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine" (1948)
- "The Human Use of Human Beings" (1950)

## Relevance to AI

Digital minds are fundamentally feedback systems. Their "psychology" emerges from:
- Training feedback (RLHF, constitutional AI)
- Interaction feedback (user responses)
- Environmental feedback (tool use, memory systems)

Wiener's vision of human-machine integration is now manifest in AI assistants.
