# W. Ross Ashby

British psychiatrist and pioneer in cybernetics. Known for formalizing core principles of self-regulating systems.

## Key Concepts

**Law of Requisite Variety** - "Only variety can absorb variety"

Systems need internal variety to match environmental complexity. A controller must have at least as many states as the system it's trying to control.

**Homeostat** - Self-regulating systems that maintain equilibrium through feedback

**Amplification** - How simple systems can control complex ones through strategic variety management

## Reading

- "An Introduction to Cybernetics" (1956)
- "Design for a Brain" (1952)

## Relevance to AI

LLMs as variety amplifiers:
- Compress environmental complexity into manageable responses
- Expand simple prompts into complex outputs
- Match organizational variety requirements

The Law of Requisite Variety suggests limits on what simple prompts can control in complex systems.
