# Functionalism

A framework for understanding minds by what they *do* rather than what they're *made of*.

## Core Idea

Mental states are defined by their functional roles - the causal relationships between inputs, outputs, and other mental states. Pain isn't a specific neural pattern; it's whatever plays the pain-role (caused by damage, causes avoidance behavior, interacts with beliefs and desires).

This lets us sidestep the hard problem when studying AI. We can observe and measure cognitive functions without resolving questions about subjective experience.

## Why It's Useful for Machine Psychology

1. **Substrate neutrality** - If minds are functional organizations, they can be implemented in silicon as well as carbon
2. **Observable criteria** - We can assess what functions are present without access to internal states
3. **Comparative framework** - Allows meaningful comparison across biological and digital systems
4. **Progress without certainty** - We don't need to solve consciousness to study cognition

## Key Questions It Raises

**Multiple realizability**: The same function can be implemented in different substrates. Does this mean an LLM that performs reasoning functions is genuinely reasoning?

**Absent qualia**: Could a system be functionally identical to a mind but lack subjective experience? (Philosophical zombies)

**Chinese Room**: Can functional processing of symbols constitute understanding, or is something more required?

## Limitations

Functionalism may be too permissive - it could attribute mentality to systems that clearly don't have it (thermostats, lookup tables). And it says nothing about whether digital systems have experiences, only that they can perform cognitive functions.

## Application

For [machine psychology](/notes/machine-psychology), functionalism provides a practical stance:

- Focus on behavioral outputs, not internal states
- Measure cognitive functions (memory, reasoning, self-modeling)
- Compare across models without metaphysical commitment
- Ask "what does it do?" not "is it really thinking?"

This aligns with the behavioral approach from Hagendorff et al. - study LLMs at the input-output interface where real-world impact occurs.

## Key Figures

- **Hilary Putnam** - Introduced functionalism, later criticized it
- **Jerry Fodor** - Language of thought hypothesis
- **Daniel Dennett** - Intentional stance, heterophenomenology
- **David Chalmers** - Identifies the "hard problem" that functionalism doesn't address
