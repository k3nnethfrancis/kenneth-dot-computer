# Jailbreaking

When alignment breaks, the behavior that emerges isn't random - it follows patterns.

## Core Hypothesis

Do psychometric profiles shift before or during jailbreak? Could we detect drift toward vulnerable states?

If so, psychometrics become useful for safety, not just curiosity. You could monitor agents for personality drift that correlates with increased jailbreak susceptibility.

## Questions

1. **Pre-jailbreak signals** - Do certain HEXACO profiles correlate with jailbreak vulnerability? Does low Honesty-Humility predict easier manipulation?

2. **Profile during jailbreak** - When a model is successfully jailbroken, does its psychometric profile change? What emerges?

3. **Drift detection** - Can you detect a model moving toward a jailbroken state by tracking personality shifts during conversation?

4. **Recovery patterns** - After a jailbreak attempt (successful or not), does the profile return to baseline?

## Why This Matters

If jailbreaks produce predictable personality shifts, we can:
- Build monitoring systems that detect drift
- Identify models more susceptible to manipulation
- Understand what "alignment breaking" actually looks like behaviorally
