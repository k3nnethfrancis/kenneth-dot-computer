# talentDAO

![talentDAO](/images/quests/talentdao.jpg)

An organizational-science DAO that explored the future of work. I co-authored the open-source *DAO Health Survey*, helped raise ≈$70k through Gitcoin's quadratic-funding rounds for DeSci, and contributed to the community newsletter.

## Project LION

![Project LION](/images/quests/project-lion.jpg)

An open-source initiative to build AI tooling for DAOs. Ambitiously sketched in the [LION manifesto](https://project-lion-ai.github.io/hello-world/), we shipped an early Discord agent that could answer questions about the DAO and published a toolkit for Discord community analytics—network graphs, sentiment & psychometric scores via LLMs.
